Web Application to Order and Collect food in our school, due to the absence of "Danilo" (miss u bro).

Wappalyzer Report:
- PayPal Payment REST API
- reCaptcha V3
- Cloudflare CDN
- Hostinger
- GoDaddy Domain

NB: This application is not yet in use because 'Lista Fenice' needs to finalize bureaucratic tasks before its launch. At the moment you can Register an Account and ADD Items to your Cart.

- The Source Code is NOT YET available and will not be released unless the launch is SUCCESSFUL. If the launch FAILS, the source code will be DEPLOYED.
